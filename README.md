# Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple, command-line-based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Java. This project is designed as a demonstration of clean, scalable code for a low-level design.

## Features

- **Scalable Board:** The game logic supports any N x N board size.
- **Clean Architecture:** The code is organized into distinct classes with clear responsibilities (`Game`, `Board`, `Player`).
- **Command-Line Interface:** Play the game directly in your terminal.

## How to Run

1. **Compile the code:**
   ```bash
   javac src/main/java/com/tictactoe/design/*.java
   ```

2. **Run the game:**
   ```bash
   java -cp src/main/java com.tictactoe.design.Main
   ```

The game will start, and you can make moves by entering the row and column numbers when prompted.
